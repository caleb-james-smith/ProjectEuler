# Problem 19
#
# You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.
#
# 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
# Thirty days has September,
# April, June and November.
# All the rest have thirty-one,
# Saving February alone,
# Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
# And on leap years, twenty-nine.
# A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.
#
# How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?
#
# Bonus: How many total days were there during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?
#
# Bonus: How many total Sundays were there during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?
#
# Note: Strict definition of the 20th century is 1901 to 2000 inclusive. The year 1900 is in the 19th century.
