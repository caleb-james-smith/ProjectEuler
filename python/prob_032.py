# Problem 32
#
# We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once;
# for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.
# 
# The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254,
# containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
# 
# Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
# 
# HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.
#

# a x b = c
# total number of digits: 9
# must be 1-9 pandigital
