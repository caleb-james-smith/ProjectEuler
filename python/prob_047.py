# Problem 47
#
# The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:
#
# 14 = 2 × 7
# 15 = 3 × 5
#
# The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:
#
# 644 = 2^2 × 7 × 23
# 645 = 3 × 5 × 43
# 646 = 2 × 17 × 19
#
# Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors each.
# What is the first of these numbers?
